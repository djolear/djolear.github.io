I am a graduate student in the Psychology Department at Stanford University working with James Gross. 

I study the psychosocial mechanisms that enable successful self-regulation. 

I'm particularly interested in the role that affect, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status play in healthy decision-making. 

I use a combination of lab-based methods, machine learning, and path analysis to study these issues.
