I am a graduate student in the [Affective Science Area](https://psychology.stanford.edu/research/department-areas/affective-science) of the Psychology Department at Stanford University working with [James Gross](https://spl.stanford.edu/james-gross-phd-0). My research focuses on the psychosocial and environmental factors that enable successful self-regulation. I'm particularly interested in the role that affect, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status play in this domain. 

One line of my work is focused on how socioeconomic status influences health behaviors and health outcomes. A second is focused on how affect alters decision-making and whether affect regulation strategies can be used to foster healthier decisions. A third is focused on using identity to enhance peopleâ€™s motivation for engaging in adaptive patterns of decision-making. 

I employ a multimethod approach to testing hypotheses, integrating behavioral methods, computational modelling, as well as longitudinal and machine learning analyses of larger datasets, with an emphasis on reproducible and open science. 

Before coming to Stanford University, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Northwestern University where I double-majored in Psychology and English Literature. At Northwestern, I worked in the [Affective & Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory](https://acnlnorthwestern.com/) and the [Creative Cognition Laboratory](https://sites.northwestern.edu/markbeemanlab/).
