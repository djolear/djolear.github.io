I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Marketing Area at the University of Chicago Booth Business School. I currently work with [Abigail Sussman](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/abigail-sussman), [Oleg Urminksy](https://home.uchicago.edu/ourminsky/), and [Dan Bartels](https://home.uchicago.edu/bartels/).

Before coming to Booth, I received my PhD in Psychology from Stanford University where I worked in the [Affective Science Area](https://psychology.stanford.edu/research/department-areas/affective-science) with [James Gross](https://spl.stanford.edu/james-gross-phd-0). I also worked with [Baba Shiv](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/baba-shiv) and [David Rehkopf](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf). I was a fellow at the [Institute for Research in the Social Sciences](https://iriss.stanford.edu/).

My research focuses on the psychosocial and environmental factors that enable successful self-regulation. I'm particularly interested in the role that affect, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status play in this domain. One line of my work is focused on how socioeconomic status influences health behaviors and health outcomes. A second is focused on how affect alters decision-making and whether affect regulation strategies can be used to foster healthier decisions. A third is focused on using identity to enhance peopleâ€™s motivation for engaging in adaptive patterns of decision-making. 

I employ a multimethod approach to testing hypotheses, integrating behavioral methods, computational modelling, as well as longitudinal and machine learning analyses of larger datasets, with an emphasis on reproducible and open science. At Stanford, I've also been a member of the [Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab) and have a keen interest in integrating data science and machine learning methods into social science research.

Before coming to Stanford, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Northwestern University where I double-majored in Psychology and English Literature. At Northwestern, I worked in the [Affective & Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory](https://acnlnorthwestern.com/) and the [Creative Cognition Laboratory](https://sites.northwestern.edu/markbeemanlab/).
